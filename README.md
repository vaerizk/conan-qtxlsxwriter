*Conan recipe for [QtXlsxWriter (MIT)](https://github.com/VSRonin/QtXlsxWriter)*

QtXlsx is a library that can read and write Excel files.

The recipe works with a specific commit from the master-branch since there is no released (tagged) version with a CMake-based build and Qt5 support atm.

The recipe will install Qt5 as its dependency, so it doesn't rely on any existing Qt5 installation.
